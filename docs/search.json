A slide deck created for a lab meeting presentation is also linked, and summarizes the content.\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of the Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) referral process pipeline as part of the recovery for someone with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\n\n\nProject Outcomes\n\nPechakucha Presentation\n\n\n\nWebsite Wireframing using Figma\n\n\nIt is recommended to click into the link or view fullscreen for a better experience of the prototype website.\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\nCode for Philly\nDataPhilly\nR-Ladies Philly\nPhilly Data Jawn\nCity of Philadelphia\n\n\n\nRecurring Themes in Recovery\nWe observed a number of recurring themes in the qualitative data collected.\n\nEvery recovery path is unique. Often, a person’s recovery is non-linear, includes setbacks and does not have a clear end point. This can make visualizing a journey difficult, because there is no “typical” recovery.\nThe perfect recovery process is the one perfect for that person. The best recovery process is one that meets an individual exactly where they are, free of external barriers and judgment, and full of respect and compassion.\nRelapse can happen during recovery. An individual can relapse but this does not mean that their recovery is over.\nMindset for recovery. Recovery can only begin when a person is ready. Until that point, their access to harm reduction education and harm reduction services is extremely important.\nRole of long-term relationships between individuals with OUD and agencies that provide recovery services. Thanks to these long term relationships, a person knows where to turn when they are ready for help.\nStigma and recovery. If an individual was treated poorly in the past by an emergency response person or at a healthy clinic, they may refuse treatment in the future. Some abstinence-based treatment programs do not condone substance use of any kind, including MAT. Stigma exists within advocacy in the form of promoting Vivitrol, which has disadvantages when compared to buprenorphine, but cannot be diverted.\nBenefit of “Lived Experience”. When case managers can share that they have “lived experience” and are in recovery themselves, it often makes individuals more comfortable. These case managers are able to offer compassion because they have been through withdrawal and some of the same challenges themselves.\nVulnerable Populations. While there may not be a typical recovery story, it is certain that there are populations for whom there exist even more obstacles to recovery. These vulnerable populations include: homeless, uninsured, mothers, formerly incarcerated, and people with a dual diagnosis of OUD and mental illness.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The project emphasizes on local knowledge, a novel way of looking at the data and creative factors that might enhance predictability of Zillow’s modeling. While Zillow’s model works satisfactorily, this approach offers a different lens into how the model could be built stronger with intel from a variety of internal and external factors, such as amenities like schools, parks, public spaces, as well as demographic data like poverty rates, median income, crime, etc.\nIn addition to the hedonic model, this project focussed on cross validation through evaluating mean absolute error/percent error and conducting Moran’s I testing.

    "text": "Project Brief\nIn this project, my team and I had the opportunity to explore an urban issue and tackle it using urban sensors we designed and created ourselves. A few key issues we identified and wanted to address:\n\nMany kids are playing on tattered playgrounds or abandoned parking lots on the sides of public schools.\nUpdating playground equipment can cost $8,000-$50,000.\nThere is no substantial line item in the Philadelphia School District’s annual budget to support upgrading playgrounds.\nCurrently, a piecemeal system of public-private partnerships funds the handful of schoolyard-improvement projects\n1 in 5 youth in Philadelphia, the majority of whom are black or Hispanic, are overweight or obese. 70% in North Philly which is nearly double the obesity and overweight rate for youth in the United States. (Source)\n\nIn response to these findings, we prototyped a suite of interactive playground installations that we believe would not only support physical activity and learning, but could work as a powerful pilot program for transforming underserved schools and communities across the city of Philadelphia: DigiPlay.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy team and I with our final prototypes. From left to right: Gustell Preston, Stephanie Cheng, Shreya Bansal, Noah Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn creating our prototypes, we also used laser cutting, soldering, and countless different wiring and coding configurations to achieve our desired digital playground installations.\n\n\n\n\nDigiPlay works to solve this challenge of inequitable access to play by transforming dull play spacing into interactive, digitally-latent ones that encourage movement and serve as another avenue for learning and education in schools. Our solution has three major components, outfitting schools that already had some play equipment with DigiPlay sensors, Creating digital experiences for schools with no play equipment, and layering on educational components of the playground. Additionally, our solution is cost effective for schools to adopt, with 1-3 interactive installations on a playground costing about ~$300 to install and another ~$100 to maintain on a yearly basis. Thus, DigiPlay is an inexpensive way to explore the transformative potential of embedded technologies in our built environment.\nThis project is a culmination of the skills gained in the Spring 2023 Sensing the City class taught by my instructor and advisor, Professor Allison Lassiter. Find the full post of the DigiPlay project on that website here.\n\n\nExploratory Analysis\nIn our exploratory analysis, particularly when identifying which schools to employ this project, we looked at the proximity of playgrounds to schools and environmental features. To test our pilot, we chose a school closer to base called the Albert M. Greenfield playground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Outcomes\nIn total, we designed and prototyped four digital playground installations:\n\nHeart-rate sensor wall module and Musical jungle gym\n\n\n\nInteractive playfield\n\n\n\n\nPrototype testing\n\n\nThe DigiPlay full project and presentation slidedeck include more information, such as technical specifications, wiring and Arduino code tutorials, project phasing and scaling, etc.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
