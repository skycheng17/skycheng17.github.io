### Project Brief

This project aims to help Zillow better predict its housing market predictions. The project emphasizes on local knowledge, a novel way of looking at the data and creative factors that might enhance predictability of Zillowâ€™s modeling. While Zillow's model works satisfactorily, this approach offers a different lens into how the model could be built stronger with intel from a variety of internal and external factors, such as amenities like schools, parks, public spaces, as well as demographic data like poverty rates, median income, etc.
